## Issue Description

On this repository:  [https://github.com/napolev/mysite.local](https://github.com/napolev/mysite.local)

I have a very simple  `docker-compose`  project which uses:  `MySQL + Wordpress + Nginx`.

My development environment is:

```
- Windows 10 Pro
- Docker Desktop v2.2.0.5
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) > Ubuntu 18.04
- Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea838
- docker-compose version 1.17.1
```

When I run it on this environment with:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

**My problem is:**  I get the following error:

```
PHP Warning:  mysqli::__construct(): (HY000/2002): Connection refused in Standard input code on line 22
```

Here you have the full log:

Here you have a Screenshot:

When I open the website on `Chrome` (using:  `http`, I don't need:  `https`), I get the following error:
```
This page isnâ€™t working
```

When I open the website on `Firefox` (using:  `http`, I don't need:  `https`), I get the following error:
```
The connection was reset
```

The hosts file is already configured with:
```
127.0.0.1 mysite.local
127.0.0.1 www.mysite.local
```

I just want to be able to access to the website.

**docker-compose.yml**

  location ~* \.(css|gif|ico|jpeg|jpg|js|png)$ {

```

Any idea on how to make it work on my local environment (I just need  `http`, not need  `https`)?

**Requirement:** Please, use `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) > Ubuntu 18.04` as well in order to reproduce the error on the console above.
